Directory Structure:

MyProject/*		-> Java Web Service
ci/*			-> Codeigniter Framework for PHP application
ci/system/application/	-> PHP code for the website
msapp_db_dump.sql	-> Dump of the database we used for storing tokens

- If you already have the Web Server running (we had WAMP), you just need to dump the ci directory in www or htdocs folder and you should be able to access the website.

- In order to call the java web service we created, you would need to update the call with the IP of the machine on which java web service is running.
